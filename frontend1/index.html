            <h2>Omschrijving</h2>
            <p>
                Known as the "reclusive lord of the Profaned Capital", Yhorm is the descendant of an ancient conqueror, but was asked by the very people once subjugated to lead them. In the past, he was a skilled Giant combatant, powerful enough to become a lord of a city and a Lord of Cinder. During combat, attacks players massive machete that glows like embers after being brought down to a certain health threshold.
                Due to the presence of a weapon that is absurdly powerful against him that anyone can use, while also having some of the highest health and damage of the bosses, Yhorm is interesting in that he can be considered either the easiest or one of the hardest bosses in the game, depending on if one chooses to capitalize on his weakness. Siegward of Catarina can help you fight this enemy. His questline must have been completed up to this point. He is not summoned, but instead shows up via cutscene once the fog door is entered, if the questline was properly progressed. Be aware though that having him at your side may trivialize the entire fight against Yhorm. This boss is not optional - all Lords of Cinder must be defeated to advance the game.
